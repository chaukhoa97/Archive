//* The @forward rule loads a Sass stylesheet and makes its component available when your stylesheet is loaded with the @use
@forward './colorVariables';
@forward './fontSize';
.dummy {
  font-size: large;
}

//! When you load the URL of the folder, if there is _index.scss in the folder, that _index.scss will be loaded automatically
// Ở file này không dùng _colorVariables và _fontSize nhưng vẫn @forward vào
// Vì style.scss: khi dùng "@use Partial" -> automatically kẹp thêm _index.scss
// -> kẹp thêm luôn _colorVariables và _fontSize được forward ở trên
